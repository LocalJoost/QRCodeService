# QRCodeService
Show a MRTK2 (and MRTK3) service to read (and position) QR codes using HoloLens 2

If you are using this in a new project, I would _very much_ recommend starting with this branch https://github.com/LocalJoost/QRCodeService/blob/MRTK3

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE before opening issues: 
- [read this article first](https://localjoost.github.io/Reading-QR-codes-with-an-MRTK2-Extension-Service/), 
- [then read this article](https://localjoost.github.io/Positioning-QR-codes-in-space-with-HoloLens-2-building-a-'poor-man's-Vuforia'/), especially the build instructions at the end of the article

If you are using Unity 2020 and up with OpenXR, read this https://localjoost.github.io/Upgrading-reading-and-positioning-QR-codes-with-HoloLens-2-to-Unity-2020-+-OpenXR-plugin/

Note: there is also an MRKT3 version - built upon Unity 2021.3.23f1 version, MRTK3.0.0 pre-17 and the latest version of the Service Framework (currently 1.0.3) https://github.com/LocalJoost/QRCodeService/tree/MRTK3

It works. It _really_ works. All of it. I have received dozens of comments, and *everyone* of those commenters either did not read the blogs properly, or did something different that they thought would not matter. It does. This is a finicky things. But it works. Believe me.
