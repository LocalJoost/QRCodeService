PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE before opening issues: 
- [read this article first](https://localjoost.github.io/Reading-QR-codes-with-an-MRTK2-Extension-Service/'/), 
- [then read this article](https://localjoost.github.io/Positioning-QR-codes-in-space-with-HoloLens-2-building-a-'poor-man's-Vuforia'/), especially the build instructions at the end of the article
- And for this specific branch, [read this as well](https://localjoost.github.io/Upgrading-reading-and-positioning-QR-codes-with-HoloLens-2-to-Unity-2020-+-OpenXR-plugin/)

It works. It _really_ works. All of it.
